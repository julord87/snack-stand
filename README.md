This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Description

This project is a snack stand application built with React and Next.js. It allows users to view and order snacks from a menu. The application provides a seamless user experience with real-time updates as the user edits the page.

The project utilizes the Next.js framework, which offers a wide range of features and APIs for building modern web applications. It also leverages the `next/font` package to optimize and load the Inter font from Google Fonts.

To get started, simply run the development server using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.
